  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='large'>T</span>he materials for this work were collected during my
travels on the Amazon and its tributaries from 1848 to
1852. Though principally occupied with the varied
and interesting animal productions of the country, I yet
found time to examine and admire the wonders of
vegetable life which everywhere abounded. In the vast
forests of the Amazon valley, tropical vegetation is to
be seen in all its luxuriance. Huge trees with buttressed
stems, tangled climbers of fantastic forms, and
strange parasitical plants everywhere meet the admiring
gaze of the naturalist fresh from the meadows and
heaths of Europe. Everywhere too rise the graceful
Palms, true denizens of the tropics, of which they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>the most striking and characteristic feature. In the
districts which I visited they were everywhere abundant,
and I soon became interested in them, from their great
variety and beauty of form and the many uses to which
they are applied. I first endeavoured to familiarize
myself with the aspect of each species and to learn to
know it by its native name; but even this was not a
very easy matter, for I was often unable to see any difference
between trees which the Indians assured me
were quite distinct, and had widely different properties
and uses. More close examination, however, convinced
me that external characters did exist by which every
species could be separated from those most nearly allied
to it, and I was soon pleased to find that I could distinguish
one palm from another, though barely visible
above the surrounding forest, almost as certainly as the
natives themselves. I then endeavoured to define the
peculiarities of form or structure which gave to each its
individual character, and made accurate sketches and
descriptions to impress them upon my memory. These
peculiarities are often very slight, though permanent:—in
the roots, the extent to which they appear above the
ground;—in the stem, the thickness, which in each
species varies within very definite limits,—the swelling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>the base, the middle or the summit,—its generally erect
or curving position,—the nature of the rings with which
it is marked,—the number, direction and form of the
spines or tubercles with which it is armed;—in the
leaves, the erect or drooping position, the size and form
of the leaflets, the angles which they form with the
midrib, and the proportionate size of the terminal pair,
are all important characters. The fruit spike or spadix
is either erect or drooping, either simple, forked, or many-branched;
and the fruits in closely allied species vary
in size, in shape, and in colour, as well as in the bloom,
down, hairs or tubercles with which they are clothed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this little work careful engravings from my original
drawings are given, with a general description of each
species, and a history from personal observation of the
various uses to which it is applied, and of any other
interesting particulars connected with it. Several of
the species here figured are new, and among them is
the Palm which produces the “piassába,” the coarse
fibrous material of which brooms for street sweeping
are now generally made.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the determination of the genera and species, and
for that part of the Introduction relating to the botanical
characters and geographical distribution of Palms, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>indebted to the magnificent work of Dr. Martius. To
the botanist I trust my little book may be of some use,
in giving accurate figures of many entire plants, of
which he is only acquainted with small portions, and in
supplying an account of the uses to which they are
applied in the distant regions where they grow. And
to the general reader I hope it may not be uninteresting,
as exhibiting a glimpse of a wild and rude people in
the lowest state of civilization, whose existence is intimately
connected with the products of the surrounding
forests, among which the plants under consideration
hold so prominent a place; and of these it is hoped the
accompanying Plates will give a more accurate idea
than the stereotyped figures which often represent the
“feathery palm trees” in our popular works.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the fruits of which I had no drawings, have
been figured from specimens in the Museum at Kew
collected by Mr. R. Spruce, who is still investigating
the Botany of the Amazon valley.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='large'>P</span>alms are endogenous or ingrowing plants, belonging
to the same great division of the Vegetable Kingdom
as the Grasses, Bamboos, Lilies and Pineapples, and
not to that which contains all our English forest trees.
They are perennial, not annual like most of the above-named
plants, and probably reach a great age. Their
stems are simple or very rarely forked, slender, erect,
and cylindrical, not tapering as in most other trees;
they are hardest on the outside, and are marked more or
less distinctly with scars or rings, marking the situation
of the fallen leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves are generally terminal, forming a bunch
or head at the summit of the tree; they are of very
large size, have long petioles or footstalks, and are
alternately placed on the stem. In shape they are
pinnate or flabellate, or rarely simple, sheathing at the
base, without stipules; and they have a plicate vernation,
or are folded up lengthways before they open.
The margins of the sheathing bases of the leaf-stalks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>are often fibrous, and give out a variety of singular
processes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flowers are numerous, small, symmetrical, uncoloured,
or obscurely so, six-parted, and hermaphrodite
or polygamous. They are produced in a spadix from
the axils of the leaves, and are generally enclosed in a
spathe or sheath. The ovary or seed-vessel is three-celled
or three-lobed, but the fruit is generally one-seeded
from abortion, and the seed is large and albuminous
with a fibrous or fleshy covering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palms are almost exclusively tropical plants, very
few species being found in the temperate zone, and
those only in the warmer parts of it, while the nearer
we approach the equator the more numerous they
become both in species and individuals. Dr. Martius,
a Prussian botanist and traveller in South America, has
published a magnificent work in three folio volumes,
entirely devoted to the Botanical history of this family
of plants. He divides the portion of the earth which
produces palms into five regions, namely,—</p>

<p class='c007'>The North Palm Zone, extending from the northern
limit of Palms to the tropic of Cancer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transition North Palm Zone, from the tropic of
Cancer to 10° north latitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chief Palm Zone, from 10° north to 10° south
latitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transition South Palm Zone, from 10° south
latitude to the tropic of Capricorn, and</p>

<p class='c007'>The South Palm Zone, from the tropic of Capricorn
to the southern limit of the family.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The Northern limit of Palms is, in Europe 43° of
latitude, in Asia 34°, and in America 34°.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern limit is 34° in Africa, 38° in New
Zealand, and 36° in South America.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the north of the tropic of Cancer there are 43
species of Palms known, and to the south of the
tropic of Capricorn only 13, while as we advance
from either side towards the equator the number increases,
until in the Chief Zone, between 10° north
and 10° south latitude, there are more than 300
species (see Frontispiece Map).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Old World, the rich islands of the Eastern
Archipelago produce the greatest number of Palms; in
the New, the great valleys of the Amazon and Orinoco
on the main land, are most prolific.</p>

<p class='c007'>In proportion to its extent, America is the most productive
palm country; for while the Old World, including
Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Eastern Archipelago,
with New Holland and all the Pacific Islands,
contain 307 species, the New World or America alone
has 275 different kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Old World the islands produce more species
than the continents, the former containing 194, while
the latter have only 113.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the New World, however, the reverse is the case,
the continent there containing 234, while the islands
possess only 42 kinds of Palms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The total number of Palms at present known is less
than 600. Dr. Martius thinks that the probable number
existing on the earth may be from 1000 to 1200;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>though, as similar calculations have hitherto almost invariably
been proved, as our knowledge increased, to be
far below the truth, it is not unlikely that a few years
may render double this number a more probable estimate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palms present to our view the most graceful and
picturesque, as well as some of the most majestic forms
in the vegetable kingdom. Though many of them have
a sameness of aspect, yet there is a sufficient contrast
and variety of forms to render them interesting objects
in the landscape. The stems in some species do not
appear above the ground, in others they rise to the
height of 200 feet; some resemble reeds and are no
thicker than a goose quill, others swell out to the bulk
of a hogshead. There are climbing palms too, which
trail their long flexible stems over trees and shrubs, or
hang in tangled festoons between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trunks of some are almost perfectly smooth,
others rough with concentric rings, or clothed with a
woven or hairy fibrous covering, which binds together
the sheathing bases of the fallen leaves. Many are
thickly beset with cylindrical or flat spines, often 8 or
10 inches long and as sharp as a needle; and the
fallen leaves and stems of these offer a serious obstacle
to the traveller who attempts to penetrate the tropical
forests.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves are large and often gigantic, surpassing
those of any other family of plants. In some species
they are 50 feet long and 8 wide; these are pinnate or
composed of numerous long narrow leaflets placed at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>right angles to the midrib, but in others the leaves are
entire and undivided, and yet are 30 feet or more in
length and 4 or 5 in width. But the most remarkable
form of leaf is the fan-shaped, which characterizes a considerable
number of species, and gives them such a
completely different aspect, as to render it, to ordinary
observers, the most palpable feature dividing the whole
family into two distinct groups. The Palms having
fan-shaped leaves are, however, comparatively few, being
only 91 out of 582 known species.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, generally of
a white, pale yellow or green colour, but often produced
in such dense masses as to have a striking appearance.
They sometimes emit a very powerful odour, which
attracts swarms of minute insects; and a newly-burst
palm spathe may often be discovered by the buzzing
cloud of small flies and beetles which hover over it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fruits are generally small, when compared with
the size of the trees; the common cocoa-nut being one
of the largest in the whole family. The kernel of many
is too hard to be eaten, and the outer covering is often
fibrous or woody; but in others the seeds are covered
with a pulpy or farinaceous mass, which in most cases
furnishes a grateful and nutritious food.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purposes to which the different parts of Palms
are applied are very various, the fruit, the leaves, and
the stem all having many uses in the different species.
Some of them produce valuable articles of export to our
own and other countries, but they are of far more value
to the natives of the districts where they grow, in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>cases furnishing the most important necessaries for
existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cocoa-nut is known to us only as an agreeable
fruit, and its fibrous husk supplies us with matting,
coir ropes, and stuffing for mattresses; but in its native
countries it serves a hundred purposes; food and drink
and oil are obtained from its fruit, hats and baskets are
made of its fibre, huts are covered with its leaves, and
its leaf-stalks are applied to a variety of uses. To us
the Date is but an agreeable fruit, but to the Arab it is
the very staff of life; men and camels almost live upon
it, and on the abundance of the date harvest depends
the wealth and almost the existence of many desert
tribes. It is truly indigenous to those inhospitable
wastes of burning sand, which without it would be uninhabitable
by man.</p>

<p class='c007'>A palm tree of Africa, the <i>Æleis guianensis</i>, gives us
oil and candles. It inhabits those parts of the country
where the slave trade is carried on, and it is thought by
persons best acquainted with the subject that the extension
of the trade in palm oil will be the most effectual
check to that inhuman traffic; so that a palm tree
may be the means of spreading the blessings of civilization
and humanity among the persecuted negro race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sago is another product of a palm, which is of comparatively
little importance to us, but in the East supplies
the daily food of thousands. In many parts of the
Indian Archipelago it forms almost the entire subsistence
of the people, taking the place of rice in Asia, corn
in Europe, and maize and mandiocca in America, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>is worthy to be classed with these the most precious
gifts of nature to mankind. Unlike them, however, it
is neither seed nor root, but is the wood itself, the
pithy centre of the stem, requiring scarcely any preparation
to fit it for food; and it is so abundant that a
single tree often yields six hundred pounds weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The canes used for chair bottoms and various other
purposes, are the stems of species of <i>Calamus</i>, slender
palms which abound in the East Indian jungles, climbing
over other trees and bushes by the help of the long hooked
spines with which their leaves are armed. They
sometimes reach the enormous length of 600 or even
1000 feet, and as four millions of them are imported
into this country annually, a great number of persons
must find employment in cutting them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A variety of species, in all parts of the world, furnish a
sugary sap from their stems or unopened spathes, which
when partly fermented is the palm wine of Africa and
the Toddy of the East Indies; and a similar beverage
is procured from the <i>Mauritia vinifera</i> and other species
in South America. Indeed, at the mouth of the Orinoco
dwell a nation of Indians whose existence depends
almost entirely on a species of Palm, supposed to be
the <i>Mauritia flexuosa</i>. They build their houses elevated
on its trunks, and live principally upon its fruit and
sap, with fish from the waters around them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the most singular products of palm trees are
the resins and wax produced by some species. The
fruits of a species of <i>Calamus</i> of the Eastern Archipelago
are covered with a resinous substance of a red colour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>which, in common with a similar product from some
other trees, is the Dragon’s blood of commerce, and is
used as a pigment, for varnish, and in the manufacture
of tooth powder. The <i>Ceroxylon andicola</i>, a lofty palm
growing in the Andes of Bogotá, produces a resinous
wax which is secreted in its stem and used by the inhabitants
of the country for making candles and for
other purposes. Again, in some of the northern provinces
of Brazil is found a palm tree called Carnaúba,
the <i>Copernicia cerifera</i>, having the underside of its
leaves covered with white wax, which has no admixture
of resin, but is as pure as that procured from our hives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves of palms, however, are applied to the
greatest variety of uses; thatch for houses, umbrellas,
hats, baskets and cordage in countless varieties are made
from them, and every tropical country possesses some
species adapted to these varied purposes, which in temperate
zones are generally supplied by a very different
class of plants. The Chip, or Brazilian-grass hats, so
cheap in this country, are made from the leaves of a
palm tree which grows in Cuba, whence they are imported
for the purpose: the palm is the <i>Chamærops
argentea</i>; and in Sicily an allied species, the <i>Chamærops
humilis</i> (the only European palm), is applied in a similar
manner to form hats, baskets, and a variety of useful
articles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The papyrus of the ancient Egyptians, and the metallic
plates on which other nations wrote, were not
used in India, but their place was supplied by the leaves
of palms, on whose hard and glossy surface the characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of the Pali and Sanscrit languages were inscribed
with a metallic point. The leaves of the <i>Corypha taliera</i>
are used for this purpose, and when strung together,
form the volumes of a Hindu library.</p>

<p class='c007'>A favourite stimulant too of the Malays is furnished
by a palm. The fruit of the <i>Areca catechu</i> is the betelnut,
which they chew with lime, and which is their
substitute for the opium of the Chinese, the tobacco of
Europeans, and the coca of the South Americans.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most recent introductions into our own
domestic economy is the fibre of a palm, the Piassaba,
which is now generally used for coarse brooms and
brushes; and in the valley of the Amazon, of which it
is a native, the same material is manufactured into
cables, which are cheap and very durable in the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now glanced at a few of the most important
uses to which Palms are applied, but in order to be able to
appreciate how much the native tribes of the countries
where they most abound are dependent on this noble family
of plants, and how they take part in some form or other
in almost every action of the Indian’s life, we must
enter into his hut and inquire into the origin and structure
of the various articles we shall see around us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose then we visit an Indian cottage on the banks
of the Rio Negro, a great tributary of the river Amazon
in South America. The main supports of the building
are trunks of some forest tree of heavy and durable
wood, but the light rafters overhead are formed by the
straight cylindrical and uniform stems of the Jará palm.
The roof is thatched with large triangular leaves, neatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>arranged in regular alternate rows, and bound to the
rafters with sipós or forest creepers; the leaves are
those of the Caraná palm. The door of the house is a
framework of thin hard strips of wood neatly thatched
over; it is made of the split stems of the Pashiúba
palm. In one corner stands a heavy harpoon for catching
the cow-fish; it is formed of the black wood of the
<i>Pashiúba barriguda</i>. By its side is a blowpipe ten or
twelve feet long, and a little quiver full of small poisoned
arrows hangs up near it; with these the Indian
procures birds for food, or for their gay feathers, or
even brings down the wild hog or the tapir, and it is
from the stem and spines of two species of Palms that
they are made. His great bassoon-like musical instruments
are made of palm stems; the cloth in which he
wraps his most valued feather ornaments is a fibrous
palm spathe, and the rude chest in which he keeps his
treasures is woven from palm leaves. His hammock,
his bow-string and his fishing-line are from the fibres
of leaves which he obtains from different palm trees,
according to the qualities he requires in them,—the
hammock from the Mirití, and the bow-string and
fishing-line from the Tucúm. The comb which he wears
on his head is ingeniously constructed of the hard bark
of a palm, and he makes fish hooks of the spines, or uses
them to puncture on his skin the peculiar markings of
his tribe. His children are eating the agreeable red
and yellow fruit of the Pupunha or peach palm, and
from that of the Assaí he has prepared a favourite drink,
which he offers you to taste. That carefully suspended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>gourd contains oil, which he has extracted from the
fruit of another species; and that long elastic plaited
cylinder used for squeezing dry the mandiocca pulp to
make his bread, is made of the bark of one of the singular
climbing palms, which alone can resist for a considerable
time the action of the poisonous juice. In each of these
cases a species is selected better adapted
than the rest for the peculiar purpose to which it is
applied, and often having several different uses which
no other plant can serve as well, so that some little idea
may be formed of how important to the South American
Indian must be these noble trees, which supply so many
daily wants, giving him his house, his food, and his
weapons.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the lover of nature Palms offer a constant source
of interest, reminding him that he is amidst the luxuriant
vegetation of the tropics, and offering to him the
realization of whatever wild and beautiful ideas he has
from childhood associated with their name.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the equatorial regions of South America they are
seldom absent. Either delicate species flourishing in
the dense shade of the virgin forest; or lofty and massive,
standing erect on the river’s banks; or on the hill
side raising their leafy crowns on airy stems above the
surrounding trees, creating, as Humboldt styles it, “a
forest above a forest;” in every situation some are to
be met with as representatives of the magnificent and
regal family to which they belong.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following pages the genera and species are
arranged in the order adopted by Dr. Martius in his
elaborate work already alluded to.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Natural Order</span> PALMACEÆ.<br> Genus <span class='sc'>Leopoldinia</span>, <i>Martius</i>.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This genus is characterized by having flowers containing
stamens or pistils only, intermingled on the
same spadix, and by not having a spathe. The male
flowers have six stamens and no rudiments of a stigma.
The female flowers have three sessile stigmas and rudimentary
stamens. The spadix is much branched and
decomposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The species are trees of a moderate size without any
spines or tubercles, but remarkable for the netted fibres
which spring from the margins of the sheathing petioles,
and cover the stem half way down or sometimes even
to its base. The leaves are terminal and pinnate, the
leaflets spreading out regularly in one plane. There
are often three or four spadices on a tree, bearing
abundance of small flowers, and ovate compressed fruit,
the outer covering of which is fleshy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four species are known, and they are all found in
the same limited district near the Rio Negro, some extending
to the tributaries of the Orinoco near its
source, and one being found south of the Amazon nearly
opposite the mouth of the Rio Negro. All however
grow on the banks or in the immediate vicinity of black-ater
streams, which occur more extensively in South
America than in any other part of the globe. Two
species are described by Martius, one of which is here
figured with two others, which are believed to be new.
They are not found more than 1000 feet above the level
of the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Jará or Jará mirí (little Jará) is from ten to fifteen
feet high. The stem is cylindrical, erect, and about
two inches in diameter. The leaves are very regularly
pinnate, about four feet long, with the leaflets slightly
drooping and the terminal pair small. The leaf-stalks
are slender and the sheathing bases are persistent, giving
out from their margins abundance of flat fibrous processes
which are curiously netted and interlaced together,
clothing the stem with a firm covering often down to
the very base. At the lower part this gradually rots
and is rubbed away or falls off, leaving the stem bare.
The flower-stalks or spadices are numerous, and very
large and much branched; and the fruits are about an
inch in diameter, oval and flattened, and of a pale greenish yellow
colour. The outer covering is firm and fleshy,
and has a very bitter taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is found on the banks of the Rio Negro
and some of its tributaries, from its mouth up to its
source, and on the black-water tributaries of the
Orinoco. It never grows far from the water’s edge,
though generally out of reach of the floods in the wet
season. It is not known to occur beyond this very
limited district.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stem of this tree being very smooth and cylindrical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and of a convenient length, it is much used for
fencing round yards and gardens, and in the city of
Barra do Rio Negro is universally employed for such
purposes. The want of neatness out of doors, which is
quite a characteristic of the Portuguese and Indian
settlers on the Amazon, is always apparent in these
fences. It is never thought worth while to cut the
poles all to one length, but they are set up just as they
are brought in from the forest; and the space between
two handsome houses in the city may often be seen
filled up with a Jará railing of most unpicturesque
irregularity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bright green and glossy foliage of this tree also
renders it suitable for another purpose. On certain
saints’ days, little altars and green avenues are made
before the principal houses in Barra, the Jará palm
being always used to construct them; and its graceful
fronds rustling in the evening breeze, fitfully reflecting
the light of the wax tapers which burn before the image
of the saint, with the blazing torches of the rustic procession,
have a very pleasing effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reticulate covering of the stem of this and the
next species offers a fine station for the epiphytal
Orchideæ to attach themselves, and the Jará palms are
accordingly often adorned with their curious and ornamental
flowers.</p>

    <div>Jará assú, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Jará assú or “greater Jará” closely resembles the
last species, but it is considerably larger. The stem is
four inches in diameter and reaches thirty feet in height.
It is often much thicker at the bottom than in the upper
part, and has a greater proportion of the stem bare.
The leaves are very similar, but the spadices are larger,
and the fruit is also larger and much more abundant.</p>

<p class='c007'>This tree occurs plentifully on the lakes and inlets of
the upper Rio Negro, but is not found at the mouth of
the river like the last species. It grows too at a lower
level, being often found with a part of the stem under
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians collect the fruit in large quantities, and
by burning and washing extract a floury substance,
which they use as a substitute for salt when they cannot
procure that article. They assert positively that the
smaller species of Jará will not yield the same product;
but perhaps this may be only because the fruit is less
abundant, and they do not take the trouble to collect it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coarse Portugal salt is used in the Rio Negro, and
among the Indians in the upper part of the river serves
as a circulating medium, about a pound of it being
reckoned equivalent to a day’s work. The supply however
is very uncertain, and there are many distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>tribes which it scarcely ever reaches; and it is among
them that the substitute is manufactured from the fruit
of the Jará. It is doubtful, however, whether it contains
any true salt, for it is described as being more
bitter than saline in taste; yet with this alone to season
their fish and cassava the Indians enjoy almost perfect
health. Perhaps, therefore, mineral salt may not be such
a necessary of life as we are accustomed to consider it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This tree, the “Piassaba” of Brazil and the “Chíquichíqui”
of Venezuela, I have little hesitation in referring
to the genus <i>Leopoldinia</i>, though I have never seen it
in flower or in fruit. The texture and form of the
leaves, the peculiar branching of the spadix, and the
extraordinary development of the fibres from the margins
of the sheathing petioles, show it to be very closely
allied to the other species of this genus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stem is generally short, but reaches twenty to
thirty feet in height, and is much thicker than in either
of the preceding species. The leaves are very large
and regularly pinnate, with the pinnæ gradually smaller
to the end, as in the two former species. The leaflets are
rigid, broadest in the middle, and gradually tapering to
a fine point, spreading out flat on each side of the midrib,
but slightly drooping at the tips. The petioles are
slender and smooth. The spadix is large, excessively
branched and drooping, and there are often several on
the same tree. The marginal processes of the petioles
are interlaced as in the two former species, and are produced
into long riband-like strips, which afterwards
split into fine fibres, and hang down five or six feet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>entirely concealing the stem, and giving the tree a most
curious and unique appearance. The leaves form an
excellent thatch, and are almost universally used in
that portion of Venezuela situated on the upper Rio
Negro, and the adjacent tributaries of the Orinoco.
The fruit is said to resemble that of the Jará in colour,
but it is globose and eatable, being used principally to
form a thick drink by washing off the outer coating of
pulp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fibrous or hairy covering of the stem is an extensive
article of commerce in the countries in which it
grows. It seems to have been used by the Brazilians
from a very early period to form cables for the canoes
navigating the Amazon. It is well adapted for this
purpose, as it is light (the cables made of it not sinking
in water) and very durable. It twists readily and firmly
into cordage from the fibres being rough-edged, and as
it is very abundant, and is procured and manufactured
by the Indians, piassaba ropes are much cheaper than
any other kind of cordage. The price in the city of
Barra in June 1852, was 400 reis or 1<i>s.</i> for 32 lbs. of
the fibre, and 800 reis or 2<i>s.</i> for every inch in circumference
of a cable sixty fathoms long, which is the
standard length they are all made to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the independence of Brazil, the Portuguese
government had a factory at the mouth of the Paduarí,
one of the tributaries of the Rio Negro, for the purpose
of making these cables for the use of the Pará arsenal,
and as a government monopoly. Till within these few
years the fibre was all manufactured into cordage on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the spot, but it is now taken down in long conical bundles
for exportation from Pará to England, where it is
generally used for street sweeping and house brooms,
and will probably soon be applied to many other purposes.
It is cut with knives by men, women and
children, from the upper part of the younger trees, so
as to secure the freshest fibres, the taller trees which have
only the old and half-rotten portion within reach, being
left untouched. It is said to grow again in five or six
years, the fibres being produced at the bases of the new
leaves. The trees are much infested by venomous snakes,
a species of <i>Craspedocephalus</i>, and the Indians are not
unfrequently bitten by them when at work, and sometimes
with fatal consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distribution of this tree is very peculiar. It
grows in swampy or partially flooded lands on the
banks of black-water rivers. It is first found on the
river Padauarí, a tributary of the Rio Negro on its
northern side, about 400 miles above Barra, but whose
waters are not so black as those of the Rio Negro.
The Piassaba is found from near the mouth to more
than a hundred miles up, where it ceases. On the
banks of the Rio Negro itself not a tree is to be seen.
The next river, the Darahá, also contains some. The
next two, the Maravihá and Cababurís, are white-water
rivers, and have no Piassaba. On the S. bank, though
all the rivers are black-water, there is no Piassaba till
we reach the Marié, not far below St. Gabriel. Here it
is extensively cut for about a hundred miles up, but there
is still none immediately at the mouth or on the banks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the Rio Negro. The next rivers, the Curicuríarí, the
great river Uaupés, and the Isánna, though all black-water,
have none; while further on, in the Xié, it again
appears. On entering Venezuela it is found near the
banks of the Rio Negro, and is abundant all up to its
sources, and in the Témi and Atabápo, black-water
tributaries of the Orinoco. This seems to be its
northern limit, and I cannot hear of its again appearing
in any part of the Amazon or Orinoco or their
tributaries. It is thus entirely restricted to a district
about 300 miles from N. to S. and an equal distance
from E. to W. I am enabled so exactly to mark out
its range, from having resided more than two years in
various parts of the Rio Negro, among people whose
principal occupation consisted in obtaining the fibrous
covering of this tree, and from whom no locality for it
can have remained undiscovered, assisted as they are
by the Indians, whose home is the forest, and who are
almost as well acquainted with its trackless depths as
we are with the well-beaten roads of our own island.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fibre imported into this country has been supposed
to be produced only by the <i>Attalea funifera</i>, a
species not found in the Amazon district. In the
London Journal of Botany for 1849, Sir W. Hooker
gave some account of the material, and of the tree producing
it; stating that he had received the fruit of the
tree with the fibre from a mercantile house connected
with Brazil, and that the fruit was that of the <i>Attalea
funifera</i>. This species is mentioned by Martius as
furnishing a fibre used for cordage and other purposes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in Southern Brazil, and he states that it is called
“piaçaba”; so that the Indian name is applied to two
distinct trees producing a similar material in different
localities; and the two having been brought to England
under the same name and from not very distant ports
of the same country, were naturally supposed to be
produced by the same tree. The greater part, if not all
of the Piassaba now imported, comes, however, from
the Rio Negro, where several hundred tons are cut
annually and sent to Pará, from which place scarcely a
vessel sails for England without its forming a part of
her cargo.</p>

<p class='c014'>Male and female flowers intermingled on the same
spadix, the former more abundant in the upper part of
the branches, the latter in the lower. Spathe entire,
membranaceous, fusiform and deciduous. Flowers with
bracts, male with six stamens and a rudimentary pistil,
female with three sessile stigmas. Spadix simply
branched, spreading horizontally.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are very elegant palms; their stems are lofty,
slender, smooth and faintly ringed. The leaves are
terminal, pinnate, regular, and form a graceful feathery
plume. The bases of the petioles are sheathing for a
long distance down the stem, forming a thick column
three or four feet long, of a green or reddish colour.
The spadices, three or four in number, spring from
beneath the leaves, and the spathes are very deciduous,
falling to the ground as soon as they open. The fruit
is small, globose, at first green, then violet or black,
and consists of a thin edible pulp covering the hard
seed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twelve species are known, inhabiting the West Indies,
Mexico and South America, and there appear to be
three species in the Amazon district, two of which I
have figured. Some prefer marshy grounds near the
level of the sea, others extend up the mountains to a
height of 4000 feet.</p>

    <div>Assaí, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Assaí of Pará is a tall and slender tree, from sixty
to eighty feet high, and about four inches in diameter.
The stem is very smooth, of a pale colour, and generally
waving, sometimes very much curved. The leaves are
of moderate size, of a pale bright green, regularly
pinnate, and with the leaflets much drooping. The
column formed by the sheathing bases of the leaves is
of an olive colour. The flowers are small, whitish, and
very thickly set on the simply branched spadix. There
are generally two or three, and sometimes even five or
six spadices, growing out horizontally from a little
below the leaf-column. The spathe is smooth and membranous,
and falls off as the spadix opens. The fruit
when ripe is about the size and colour of a sloe. It
consists of a hard albuminous seed, with a rather fibrous
exterior, and a very thin covering of a firm pulp or
flesh.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is very abundant in the neighbourhood
of Pará, and even in the city itself. It grows in swamps
flooded by the high tides,—never on dry land. Its
straight cylindrical stem is sometimes used for poles
and rafters; but the tree is generally considered too
valuable to be cut down for such purposes. A very
favourite drink is made from the ripe fruit, and daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>vended in the streets of Pará. Indian and negro girls
may be constantly seen walking about with small earthen
pots on their heads, uttering at intervals a shrill cry of
Assaí——í. If you call one of these dusky maidens,
she will set down her pot, and you will see it filled with
a thick creamy liquid, of a fine plum colour. A pennyworth
of this will fill a tumbler, and you may then add
a little sugar to your taste, and will find a peculiar nut-flavoured
liquid, which you may not perhaps think a
great deal of at first; but, if you repeat your experience
a few times, you will inevitably become so fond of it as
to consider “Assaí” one of the greatest luxuries the
place produces. It is generally taken with farinha, the
substitute for bread prepared from the mandiocca root,
and with or without sugar, according to the taste of
the consumer.</p>

<p class='c007'>During our walks in the suburbs of Pará we had
frequently opportunities of seeing the preparation of
this favourite beverage. Two or three large bunches
of fruit are brought in from the forest. The women of
the house seize upon them, shake and strip them into
a large earthen vessel, and pour on them warm water,
not too hot to bear the hand in. The water soon
becomes tinged with purple, and in about an hour the
outer pulp has become soft enough to rub off. The
water is now most of it poured away, a little cold added,
and a damsel, with no sleeves to turn up, plunges both
hands into the vessel, and rubs and kneads with great
perseverance, adding fresh water as it is required, till
the whole of the purple covering has been rubbed off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and the greenish stones left bare. The liquid is now
poured through a wicker sieve into another vessel, and
is then ready for use. The smiling hostess will then
fill a calabash, and give you another with farinha to
mix to your taste; and nothing will delight her more
than your emptying your rustic basin and asking her
to refill it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inhabitants of Pará are excessively attached to
this beverage, and many never pass a day of their lives
without it. They are particularly favoured too, in
being able to get it at all seasons, for though in most
places the trees only bear for a few months once in the
year, yet in the neighbourhood of Pará there is so much
variety of soil and aspect, that within a day or two’s
journey, there is always some ripe Assaí to supply the
market. Boys climb up the trees to get it, with a cord
round the ankles (as shown on the Plate), and with its
own leaves make a neatly interlaced basket to carry it
home. From the great island of Marajó, its igaripés<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
and marshes, from the rivers Guamá and Mojú, from
the thousand islands in the river, and from the vast
palm swamps in the depths of the forest, baskets of the
fruit are brought every morning to the city, where half
the population look to the Assaí to supply a daily meal,
and hundreds are said to make it, with farinha, almost
their main subsistence.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A small stream, literally “path of the canoe.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The trees of this genus also furnish another article
of food. The undeveloped leaves in the centre of the
column form a white sweetish mass, which when boiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>somewhat resembles artichoke or parsnep, and is a very
good and wholesome vegetable. It may also be eaten
raw, cut up and dressed as a salad with oil and vinegar.
As, however, to obtain it the tree must be destroyed,
it is not much used in Pará, except by travellers in the
forest who have no particular interest in the preservation
of the trees for fruit. The Cabbage Palm of the
West Indies is an allied species, and is used for food in
the same manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very fine specimens of this tree may be seen in the
great Palm House at Kew, where they grow almost as
luxuriantly as in their native forests.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Plate, the unopened spathe, flower-spadix and
fruit are represented, as they are often found, together
on the same tree.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Euterpe</span> ——?</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the banks of the Rio Negro there appears to be
another species of this genus, closely allied to the
<i>Euterpe oleracea</i>, but the stem is thicker and straighter,
the whole tree larger, and the leaf-column thicker, and
of a clear green colour. It grows on the dry land of
the virgin forest, or sometimes within the limits of the
winter’s inundations. I unfortunately neglected to
examine into its peculiar characters, as until my return
to Pará I had considered it identical with the species
so common there.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was also informed that in the island of Marajó
there is a species or variety having white fruit, but I
had no opportunity of examining it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species differs from the last in its slenderer stem
and less drooping leaves and leaflets. It grows to
forty or fifty feet high. The spadices are fewer and
much smaller. The fruit also is smaller, and has more
pulpy matter, so that a small quantity of it makes more
of the “vinho d’Assaí” (the Assaí wine) than the same
quantity of fruit of the larger kind. The column
formed by the sheathing bases of the leaves is smaller
than in the last species, and always of a red colour.
The roots rise considerably above the ground, forming
a distinct cone, which is not the case in the <i>E. oleracea</i>.
It inhabits the forests on a dry sandy soil, of the Upper
Rio Negro. These districts are called Catinga forests
by the natives, and have very peculiar vegetable productions,
differing almost entirely from those of the
lofty virgin forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparation of the fruit of this species is sweeter
and more finely flavoured than that of any other, and
is therefore much sought after, but it takes the produce
of four or five trees to yield as much as a single spadix
of the larger kind will often produce. I found the
fruit ripe in the month of April on the river Uaupés, a
branch of the Rio Negro above the Falls.</p>

distinct bracts; the male with six stamens and rudiments
of a pistil, the female with three sessile stigmas,
but with no rudiment of stamens.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are tall majestic trees with large smooth stems,
generally distinctly ringed. The leaves are large, terminal,
more or less regularly pinnate, and have the
bases expanded and clasping the stem, but not forming
a sheathing column as in the last genus. The spadices
spring from beneath the leaves and are simply branched;
the branches are very lax, hanging down vertically
except when forced outwards by the ripening fruit.
The spathe is very large, fusiform and woody, and falls
off the moment the spadix escapes from it. The fruit
is small, nearly globular, and has an edible pulpy
covering, like that of the genus <i>Euterpe</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a smooth thick-stemmed handsome tree, faintly
ringed, and reaching fifty or sixty feet in height. The
leaves are large, terminal, and pinnate. The leaflets
are long; gradually pointed, and set at equal distances
along the midrib. When young, the leaves are flat, the
leaflets or pinnæ all standing out in the same plane;
but in the full-grown tree the leaflets are in groups of
two or three standing out at different angles from the
general plane of the leaf, so as to give an irregular
mixed appearance to the leaf. The petioles are greatly
dilated at the base where they clasp the stem, and
have a fibrous margin. The leaves as they die fall
clean off from the stem, no part of the base remaining.
The spathe is deciduous, being comparatively seldom
visible. The fruits are of a violet or black colour when
ripe, but are covered with a dense whitish bloom. They
are prepared in the same way as the Assaí, but the
pulp is of a pinkish cream-colour instead of purple, and
the liquid is more oily, and of delicious flavour, somewhat
resembling filberts and cream. It is said, however,
not to be so wholesome as the Assaí, and in
districts where intermittent fevers are prevalent, to
bring them on, and to be particularly hurtful to persons
recovering from that disease. A very beautiful oil is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>sometimes extracted from the pulp by pressure; it is
perfectly clear, liquid, and inodorous; and serves as
a substitute for olive oil, as well as being very good for
lamps. The leaves are sometimes used for thatching
when none better can be obtained; but owing to the
irregularity of the pinnæ before mentioned, they are
not much used.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species inhabits the dry virgin forests of the

<p class='c006'>This species can hardly be distinguished from the
<i>Œnocarpus baccába</i> when young. In the full-grown
plant, however, the leaves preserve their regularity, the
leaflets spreading out regularly in one plane and having
a very beautiful appearance. The stem in old trees is
fifty or sixty feet high and quite smooth, but in those
growing in the shade of the forest, and in all young
trees, the stem is completely hidden by the persistent
bases of the decayed and fallen leaves. I have figured
a tree in this state (Plate XI.).</p>

<p class='c007'>The sheathing bases of the petioles give out from
their margins numerous long spinous processes of a
very singular character. They are from eighteen inches
to three feet long, of a black colour, flattish, and generally
broken or fibrous at the point. They are much
sought after by the Indians, who use them to make
arrows for their “gravatánas” or blow-pipes. One of
these arrows is here represented with the wicker quiver
in which they are carried. They are about fifteen or
eighteen inches long, sharply pointed at the end, which
is covered with “curarí” poison for three or four inches
down, and notched so as to break off in the wound.
Near the bottom a little of the soft down of the silk-cotton-tree
is twisted round into a smooth spindle-haped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>mass, and carefully secured with a fibre of a
“<i>bromelia</i>.” The cotton just fits easily into the tube,
offering a light resisting body for the breath to act
upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fruit of this species is very similar to that of the
Baccába, and is said to be of even superior flavour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Patawá is found in the whole of the Amazon
and Rio Negro in the virgin forest, though apparently
nowhere very abundant. Specimens are now growing
in the Palm House at Kew.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fruit is represented on Pl. X. of the natural size.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Œnocarpus minor</span>, <i>Martius</i>.<br> Baccába miri, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</h3>

<p class='c014'>This is a small species common on the upper Rio
Negro. The stem is not half so thick as in the
<i>Œ. baccába</i>, and the leaves are in proportion. The
fruit is also very small, but is very fleshy and fine-flavoured,
and ripens at a different time of year from
the larger kind. It grows in the dry virgin forest. My
drawing of this tree was unfortunately lost on my
voyage home.</p>

    <div>Baccába, of Pará.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is the species known as the Baccába at Pará,
where the <i>Œ. baccába</i> is not found. It is quite distinct
from the allied species by the leaves being distichous,
or arranged nearly in one plane on each side of the
stem, which gives it a very peculiar aspect, unlike any
other Palm.</p>

<p class='c007'>On my return to Pará from the interior, I was
suffering so much from ague, as to be unable to go in
search of a specimen of this tree to figure as I had
intended.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, like all other species of the genus, grows in
dry and rather elevated forest land.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>Genus <span class='sc'>Iriartea</span>, <i>Ruiz</i> et <i>Pavon</i>.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Female flowers few, interspersed among the males,
bracteate. Spathe membranous, incomplete. Male
flowers with from twelve to fifty stamens and the
rudiments of a pistil. Female flowers with three
sessile stigmas.</p>

<p class='c007'>These singular and beautiful Palms have lofty,
smooth, cylindrical or ventricose stems, very faintly
ringed. The roots grow more or less above ground.
The leaves are terminal and pinnate, and the leaflets
are somewhat triangular, notched, often twisted or
curled, and have radiating nerves. The sheathing
bases form a column as in <i>Euterpe</i>. The spadices
grow from beneath the leaves and are simply branched
and drooping. The spathes vary in number and size;
they are membranous, and fall off before the fruit
ripens. The fruit is oval, of moderate size, generally
of a red or yellow colour, and the pulpy part is bitter
and uneatable. The stems of this genus increase in
thickness within certain limits, differing from most
other palms, which, when the stem is once formed,
only increase in height.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nine species of this genus are known, all natives of
South America. Four of them occur in the Amazon
district, three in Bolivia, one in Venezuela, and one
near Bogotá, reaching a height above the sea of 5000
to 8000 feet.</p>

    <div>Pashiúba, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This curious and beautiful tree is common in the
forests about Pará and on the banks of the Amazon.
It reaches fifty or sixty feet in height, with the stem
moderately thick and very smooth, there being scarcely
any rings or scars left by the fallen leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves are large and pinnate, with the leaflets
triangular and very deeply notched, standing out at
different angles with the midrib. The leaves curve over
gracefully, and the character and aspect of the foliage
is very different from that of most other palms. The
column formed by the sheathing leaf-stalks is swollen at
the base and of a deep green colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices are three or four in number, growing
rather upwards from the stem below the leaf-column.
They are small and simply branched, and bear small
oval red fruits about the size of a damson, the outer
pulp of which is bitter and only eaten by some birds.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what most strikes attention in this tree, and
renders it so peculiar, is, that the roots are almost
entirely above ground. They spring out from the stem,
each one at a higher point than the last, and extend
diagonally downwards till they approach the ground,
when they often divide into many rootlets, each of
which secures itself in the soil. As fresh ones spring
out from the stem, those below become rotten and die
off; and it is not an uncommon thing to see a lofty
tree supported entirely by three or four roots, so that a
person may walk erect beneath them, or stand with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>tree seventy feet high growing immediately over his
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the forests where these trees grow, numbers of
young plants of every age may be seen, all miniature
copies of their parents, except that they seldom possess
more than three legs, which gives them a strange and
almost ludicrous appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The figure on the opposite page (Plate XIII.) represents
accurately the roots of a tree which had been
partly blown down in the forest of the Upper Rio
Negro. My friend Mr. Spruce informs me that it is
a distinct species from that found at Pará, though
closely allied to it, and scarcely differing in the character
of the roots.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wood of these trees is very hard on the outside,
but soft and pithy within. It splits easily and very
straight, and is much used for forming the floors of
canoes, the ceilings of houses, shelves, seats, and various
other purposes. Perfectly straight laths are more
readily made from it than from any other wood, and
they are so hard and durable as to serve for fish-weirs,
corals for turtles, and for harpoons. The air-roots are
covered with tubercular prickles, and are used by some
Indians to grate their mandiocca.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species grows in swamps or marshy ground in
the virgin forest, not in the tide-flooded lands on the
river banks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young plants may be seen in the great Palm House
at Kew.</p>

    <div>Pashiúba barriguda, <i>Brazil</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is the most majestic tree of the genus. The
stem reaches eighty or a hundred feet in height, and
besides being rather thicker in proportion than in the
last species, offers a remarkable character in being constantly
more or less swollen near the middle or towards
the top. The trunk is generally cylindrical to a height
of forty or fifty feet, where it swells out to double its
former diameter or more for ten or fifteen feet further,
when it again diminishes and becomes cylindrical for
about twenty feet to the summit. It is only when the
trees have reached their full height or nearly so that
the swelling commences. In a forest where they
abound many may be seen of a large size, but quite
cylindrical from top to bottom, while others present
every degree of swelling from a just perceptible thickening
to a most extraordinary enlargement. The
column of air-roots in this species is six or eight feet
high, forming a compact conical mass, the separate
roots being more slender than in the <i>Iriartea exorhiza</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves are very large, with the leaflets broadly
triangular and much cut and waved, forming a very
elegant and yet massive head of foliage. The leaf-olumn
is very thick, much swollen at the base, and of
a deep bluish green colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unopened spathes are lunate in shape and curved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>downwards, and the spadices are small and simply
branched.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wood of this tree is very hard, heavy and black,
and is used by the Indians for making harpoons and
spears with which they hunt the cow-fish. The swollen
part of the stem is sometimes cut down and made into
a canoe, when one is required in a hurry; otherwise it
is not made use of.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tree grows on the Upper Amazon and Rio Negro,
on hill sides and on the banks of brooks and springs;
and the Indians say that wherever it abounds sarsaparilla
will be found growing near.</p>

    <div>Pashiúba miri, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This small species has the stem from fifteen to twenty
feet high, and varying from the thickness of a finger
to that of the wrist, which it never exceeds. The stem
is smooth and cylindrical, but distinctly ringed. The
roots appear only a few inches above the ground. The
leaves are pinnate, the leaflets elongate, triangular and
cut at the ends. The column is short and cylindrical,
and both it and the petioles are covered with short hairs
or down. The spadices have long stalks and grow from
beneath or from among the leaves; they are rather
large and are simply branched. The spathes form
sheaths at the bases of the spadices, and are persistent.
The fruit is oval, of an orange-red colour, and about the
size of the “hip” or wild rose fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>These trees grow on the Upper Amazon and Rio
Negro in the dry virgin forest, where they occur in
small scattered groves.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is of great importance to the Indian of
the Rio Negro. With its stem he constructs his
“gravatána” or blowing tube, which, with the little
arrows before described as made from the spines of the
Patawá, forms a most valuable weapon, enabling him
to bring down monkeys, parrots and curassow birds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>from their favourite stations on the summits of the
loftiest trees of the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he wishes to make a “gravatána” he searches
in the forest till he finds two straight and tall stems of
the “Pashiúba miri” of such proportionate thicknesses
that one could be contained within the other. When
he returns home he takes a long slender rod which he
has prepared on purpose, generally made of the hard
and elastic wood of the “Pashiúba barriguda,” and
with it pushes out the pith from both the stems, and
then with a little bunch of the roots of a tree fern,
cleans and polishes the inside till the bore becomes as
hard and as smooth as polished ebony. He then carefully
inserts the slenderer tube within the larger,
placing it so that any curve in the one may counteract
that in the other. Should it still be not quite correct,
he binds it carefully to a post in his house till it is perfectly
straight and dry. He then fits a mouth-piece of
wood to the smaller end of the tube, so that the arrow
may go out freely at the other; and when he wishes to
finish his work neatly, winds spirally round it from end
to end, the shining bark of a creeper. Near the lower
extremity he forms a sight with the large curved cutting
tooth of the Paca (<i>Cœlogenus paca</i>), which he fixes on
with pitch, and the gravatána is then fit for use.</p>

<p class='c007'>These tubes are never less than eight and are often
ten or twelve feet long, and on looking through a good
one, not the slightest irregularity can be detected from
one end to the other. The bore is generally not large
enough to admit the tip of the little finger, so that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>breath more readily fills the whole tube and propels the
arrow with great velocity. The vertical direction is
that in which the surest aim can be taken, and for
which the gravatána is best adapted. When birds are
feeding at the top of a lofty tree where the result of a
gun-shot would be doubtful, a skilful Indian will take
his station beneath it, and with a puff from his powerful
lungs, will send up his little poisoned arrows with unerring
aim. The wounded birds sometimes turn giddy
and drop in a few seconds, or fly away to a neighbouring
tree and in a minute fall heavily to the ground, or
try to pluck out the arrows with their beaks, which,
however, invariably break in the wound. The hunter
carefully marks the direction in which each one falls,
and when his quiver is emptied of arrows or the tree
of birds, walks round and gathers up the game. His
weapon makes no noise, and he therefore often does
more execution than the best European sportsman
armed with his double-barrel Manton.</p>

    <div>Jupatí, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is one of the most striking of the many noble
Palms which grow on the rich alluvium of the Amazon.
Its comparatively short stem enables us fully to appreciate
the enormous size of its leaves, which are at the
same time equally remarkable for their elegant form.
They rise nearly vertically from the stem and bend out
on every side in graceful curves, forming a magnificent
plume seventy feet in height and forty in diameter. I
have cut down and measured leaves forty-eight and
fifty feet long, but could never get at the largest. The
leaflets spread out four feet on each side of the midrib.
They are rather irregularly scattered and not very
closely set; they droop at the tips and have weak
spinules along the margins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stem does not generally exceed six or eight feet
in height and is about a foot in diameter, clothed for
some distance down with the persistent sheathing bases
of the leaf-stalks and the numerous spinous processes
which proceed from them. These spines are something
like those of the “Patawá,” but not so thick and strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices are very large, compoundly branched
and drooping; they grow from among the leaves and
have numerous bract-like sheaths in the place of spathes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flowers are of a greenish olive colour and densely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>crowded, and the fruit is large, oblong, and reticulated
with large scales.</p>

<p class='c007'>The petiole or leaf-stalk of this tree is most extensively
useful. It is often twelve or fifteen feet long
below the first leaflets, and four or five inches in diameter,
perfectly straight and cylindrical. When dried,
it almost equals the quill of a bird for strength and
lightness, owing to its thin hard outer covering and
soft internal pith. But it is too valuable to the Indian
for him to use it entire. He splits off the smooth
glossy rind in perfectly straight strips and makes
baskets and window blinds. The remaining part is of a
consistence between pith and wood, and is split up into
laths about half an inch thick and serves for a variety of
purposes. Window shutters, boxes, bird-cages, partitions
and even entire houses are constructed of it. In
the little village of Nazaré near Pará, many houses of
this kind may be seen in which all the walls are of this
material, supported by a few posts at the angles and
fastened together with pegs and slender creepers (sipós).</p>

<p class='c007'>The hand may be easily pushed through one of these
walls, but as the inhabitants do not trouble themselves
with the possession of any article worth stealing, they
sleep as composedly as if stone walls and iron bolts shut
them in with all the security of a more advanced civilization.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same material is also used for stoppers for
bottles, and we found it answer admirably for lining
our insect boxes, holding the pins securely and being
more uniform in its texture than cork.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>This is the only American species of the genus, and
it inhabits exclusively the tide-flooded lands of the
Lower Amazon and Pará rivers, being quite unknown in
the interior. When descending from the Rio Negro to
Pará in the summer of 1852, I observed some of our
Indians who had made the voyage before, pointing out
this tree to their less travelled companions as one of the
curiosities of the lower country not to be found in the
“Sertaõ.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that the leaf, though not entire, is the
largest in the whole vegetable kingdom, some of them
covering a surface of more than 200 square feet. In a
few years we may be able to see them in the magnificent
Palm House at Kew, where young plants are now growing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Male flowers on one tree, female or hermaphrodite
flowers on another. The spathes are imperfect, bract-ike,
tubular sheaths. The male flowers have six
stamens. The female flowers have a three-lobed stigma
and six imperfect stamens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stems are either tall, columnar and smooth, or
more slender and armed with strong conical spines.
The leaves are all fan-shaped or radiating from a centre.
The spadix is very large and pinnately branched, and
grows from among the leaves. The fruits are of moderate
size, oval or globular, and covered with rather
small imbricated scales pointing downwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four species are described by Martius, three of which
occur in the Amazon district, and four more were met
with by me on the Rio Negro, so that the genus seems
confined to the hottest parts of the American Continent
from the level of the sea to an altitude of about 3000
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves spread out in every direction from the top
of the stem. They are very large and fan-shaped, the
leaflets spreading out rigidly on all sides and only
drooping at the tips and at the midrib or elongation of
the petiole. The leaves stand on long stalks which are
very straight and thick, and much swollen at the base
which clasps the stem. A full-grown fallen leaf of this
tree is a grand sight. The expanded sheathing base is
a foot in diameter; the petiole is a solid beam ten or
twelve feet long, and the leaf itself is nine or ten in
diameter. An entire leaf is a load for a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow out from among the leaves; they
are very large, pinnately branched and horizontal or
drooping. The fruit is spherical, the size of a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>apple and covered with rather small, smooth, brown,
reticulated scales, beneath which is a thin coating of
pulp. A spadix loaded with fruit is of immense weight,
often more than two men could carry between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves, fruit and stem of this tree are all useful
to the natives of the interior. The leaf-stalks are
applied to the same purposes as those of the species last
described, the Jupatí. The epidermis of the leaves
furnishes the material of which the string for hammocks,
and cordage for a variety of purposes is made. The
unopened leaves form a thick-pointed column rising
from the very centre of the crown of foliage. This is
cut down, and by a little shaking the tender leaflets
fall apart. Each one is then skilfully stripped of its
outer covering, a thin riband-like pellicle of a pale
yellow colour which shrivels up almost into a thread.
These are then tied in bundles and dried, and are afterwards
twisted by rolling on the breast or thigh into
string, or with the fingers into thicker cords. The
article most commonly made from it is the “réde,” or
netted hammock, which is the almost universal bed of
the native tribes of the Amazon. These are formed by
doubling the string over two rods or poles about six or
seven feet apart, till there are forty or fifty parallel
threads, which are then secured at intervals of about a
foot by cross strings twisted and tied on to every longitudinal
one. A strong cord is then passed through the
loop formed by all the strings brought together at each
end, by which the hammock is hung up a few feet from
the ground, and in this open net the naked Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>sleeps beside his fire as comfortably as we do in our
beds of down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other tribes twist the strings together in a complicated
manner so that the hammock is more elastic,
and the Brazilians have introduced a variety of improvements
by using a kind of knitting needles producing a
closer web, or by a large wooden frame with rollers, on
which they weave in a rude manner with a woof and
weft as in a regular loom. They also dye the string of
many brilliant colours which they work in symmetrical
patterns, making the rédes or “maqueiras” as they are
there called, among the gayest articles of furniture to be
seen in a Brazilian house on the Amazon.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the fruits a favourite Indian beverage is produced.
They are soaked in water till they begin to
ferment, and the scales and pulpy matter soften and can
be easily rubbed off in water. When strained through
a sieve it is ready for use, and has a slight acid taste
and a peculiar flavour of the fruit at first rather
disagreeable to European palates.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the tidal districts about Pará, the massive trunks
of these trees are often used to form a raised pathway
across the expanse of soft mud generally left at low
water between “terra firma” and the water’s edge.
A smooth and slippery cylinder is certainly not the best
thing that could be devised for this purpose, but as it is
the most easily procured and the least expensive it is
proportionately common, and on paying a visit to many
a Brazilian country house, should you arrive at low
water, you will have no other means of getting ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The Miriti is a social palm, covering large tracts of
tide-flooded lands on the Lower Amazon. In these
places there is no underwood to break the view among
interminable ranges of huge columnar stems rising undisturbed
by branch or leaf to the height of eighty or a
hundred feet,—a vast natural temple which does not
yield in grandeur and sublimity to those of Palmyra or
Athens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the age of these noble trees we have no knowledge,
but it is remarkable how uniform they appear in
size, there often being not a single young tree over
a considerable extent of ground, particularly in places
now flooded daily by the tide. One would therefore
imagine that the present trees sprung up when the
ground was more elevated than at present, and that it
has since gradually sunk (or the waters risen) till the
conditions have become unfavourable for the growth of
young plants, though not hurtful to those which had
already attained a certain age. Whether such is the
true explanation of the phænomenon can only be
decided by continued observation on the spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this species which is mentioned by Martius
as occurring at Pará, my friend Mr. Spruce ascertained
that another closely allied palm, the <i>Mauritia
vinifera</i>, also occurs there. On the Upper Amazon and
Rio Negro a palm is found supposed to be the <i>M.
flexuosa</i>, but it is not so lofty a tree, which may perhaps
be accounted for by its growing on annually instead
of diurnally flooded lands. It is believed to be
the same species which Humboldt observed on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Serra Duida. The Itá palm growing on the delta of
the Orinoco is also thought to be the same species.
On the river Uaupes, a branch of the Upper Rio Negro,
I observed an allied species called by the natives “Caraná
assu.” The stem was smooth and much more
slender and waving, and the leaves much smaller.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plants of the <i>Mauritia flexuosa</i> are growing in the
Palm House at Kew.</p>

    <div>Caraná, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is a large smooth-stemmed species allied to
<i>M. flexuosa</i>, but quite distinct and hitherto undescribed.
The stem is about a foot in diameter and from twenty
to forty feet high, smooth and obscurely ringed. The
leaves are very similar to those of the Mirití, but the
leaflets are not so deeply divided, being united together
at the base for one-third of their entire length, and
much more drooping at the tips. The petioles are
very large, straight and cylindrical; their dilated
bases are persistent for a considerable distance down
the stem, and their margins give out a quantity of
fibres which clothe it as in the <i>Leopoldinia piassaba</i>,
though rather less densely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from among the leaves and are
somewhat more erect and much smaller than in the
Mirití, and the fruits are less abundant, smaller and
slightly ovate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaf-stalks of this species are used for the same
purposes as those of the Mirití and Jupatí already described,
as those palms are generally absent where
this is abundant. The part most generally used, however,
is the leaf, which for thatching is preferred to
that of any other species, on account of its having so
large a portion of the base entire and being of a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>durable texture. A roof well-thatched with Caraná
will last eight or ten years without renewing, and the
leaves are so constantly cut for this purpose that it is
hardly possible to find an entire and handsome tree.
Though so closely resembling the Mirití, the epidermis
is never used for cordage, and on my asking an Indian
the reason, he quite laughed at the idea, saying that it
was quite impossible because the Caraná “did not produce
any thread.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This tree grows in the district of the Rio Negro and
Upper Orinoco, but is not found on the Amazon. It
prefers the dry Catinga forests, or the sandy margins of
streams out of reach of the highest floods. At Javita
I observed it growing within a few yards of the Mirití,
but still preserving all its distinctive characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is called by the natives Caraná, the smaller prickly
stemmed species being known by the name of Caranaí.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species has a tall, erect and slender stem reaching
about forty or fifty feet in height and armed with
numerous, long, conical, woody spines arranged in
rings. The leaves are rather small with the leaflets
rigid and very slightly drooping at the tips, and united
at the base for about one-eighth of their length. The
petioles are long and slender and are deciduous, the
entire leaf falling away from the stem. The midrib
and edges of the leaflets are armed with weak spinules.
The spadices are small and grow somewhat erect so as
to be partly concealed among the leaves, and the fruit
is oval and rather small.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species grows on the Upper Rio Negro and
Atabapo, in marshes, with a rocky subsoil, and in the
moist parts of the Catinga forest. The Caraná, common
in the swamps (not in the tide-flooded lands) about
Pará, is very closely allied or may be the same species.</p>

smaller than in <i>M. aculeata</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves are from five to eight in number with
much-drooping leaflets. The petioles are slender, short,
and greatly dilated at the base. The spadices are three
or four in number, growing from among the leaves, of
very large size in proportion to the tree, much branched
and drooping. They bear great quantities of fruit,
which is of an oval shape and nearly as large as that of
the <i>Mauritia carana</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This beautiful little palm is first met with about
Barcellos on the Rio Negro, more than 300 miles up
the river, and is thence common as far as the black-water
tributaries of the Orinoco. It always grows
close to the water’s edge in clumps of thirty or forty
individuals, and its drooping leaves of a pale hoary
green colour, never so much crowded as to lose their
distinct outline, with the bending clusters of rich brown
fruit, render it one of the greatest ornaments of its
native river. The fruit is eaten, after being softened by
soaking some time in water.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems closely allied to <i>M. armata</i> of Martius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>which is found much farther south, on the banks of
the S. Francisco River, but is probably quite a distinct
species.</p>

<p class='c006'>This curious little palm is only eight or ten feet high,
and has the stem slender, ringed, and armed with strong
conical spines. The leaves are rather small and few in
number, and the leaflets are much shorter, broader and
more rigid than in any other palm of this genus. The
petioles are long and rather thick, much sheathing at
the bases which are persistent, clothing the stem some
distance down after the leaves have dropped away from
them, a character not found in any other prickly stemmed
species. The spadix is very long, branched
and drooping. The fruit was not seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a very closely allied species abundant in
certain parts of the flooded lands or “gapó” of the
Rio Negro, which is much used for thatching. The
leaves being cut, the leaf-stalks are doubled and hitched
on side by side to a strip of “pashiúba,” and secured
with “sipós” (which are the air-roots of <i>Arums</i> and
other plants). They are said to make one of the most
durable kinds of roof, and are much used for covering
the semicircular “toldas” of canoes. They are also
considered the best material for lining baskets of salt,

<p class='c006'>This unique and handsome palm has the stem from ten
to fifteen feet high, curved or crooked and deeply
ringed. The leaves are very large, entire, rigid and
furrowed, and have a serrated margin; they are often
thirty feet long and four or five wide, and split irregularly
with age. The petioles are slender with a
broadly expanded fibrous-edged sheath at the base.
These sheaths are persistent and often cover the stem
down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices are numerous, growing from among the
leaves, and are simply branched and drooping. The
fruit is of an olive colour, somewhat three-lobed and
with a rugose or papillate exterior covering. The
spathe is fusiform and entire, of a fibrous cloth-like
texture and of a brown colour. As the spadix expands
it breaks open irregularly, but in some cases a dead
unopened flower bunch is found enclosed in an entire
half-rotten spathe, as if the vital powers of the plant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>had not been sufficient to tear asunder the tough
fibrous sheath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “bussú” produces the largest entire leaves of
any known palm, and for this reason, as well as on
account of their firm and rigid texture, they form the
very best and most durable thatch. The leaves are
split down the midrib and the halves laid obliquely on
the rafters, so that the furrows formed by the veins lie
in a nearly vertical direction and serve as so many
little gutters to carry off the water more rapidly. A
well-made thatch of “bussú” will last ten or twelve
years, and an Indian will often take a week’s voyage
in order to get a canoe-load of the leaves to cover his
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spathe too is much valued by the Indian, furnishing
him with an excellent and durable cloth.
Taken off entire it forms bags in which he keeps the
red paint for his toilet or the silk cotton for his arrows,
or he even stretches out the larger ones to make himself
a cap,—cunningly woven by nature without seam
or joining. When cut open longitudinally and pressed
flat, it is used to preserve his delicate feather ornaments
and gala dresses, which are kept in a chest of
plaited palm leaves between layers of the smooth
“bussú” cloth.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species inhabits the tidal swamps of the Lower
Amazon. A palm called “bussú” is also found on
the Rio Negro and Upper Amazon, but it is of a
smaller size and is probably a distinct species.</p>

<p class='c014'>Male flowers on the upper parts of the branches of
the spadix, females on the lower. Spathe fusiform,
woody, at length deciduous. Male flowers with six
stamens and linear acute anthers. Female flowers with
a short style and three stigmas and six small scaly
rudiments of stamens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stems slender, flexible, climbing over shrubs or trees.
Leaves alternate, pinnate, much sheathing, with long
hooked spines in the place of the three or four terminal
pair of leaflets. The spadices are axillary and simply
branched, the spathes double, fusiform or ventricose,
and the fruits are small, round, and generally red. The
stems and leaves are more or less prickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourteen species of these curious Palms are found
in various parts of South America, principally in the
low lands, as they are not known at a greater height
than 2000 feet above the level of the sea. They differ
remarkably from all other American palms in their long
climbing stems, in which they resemble the Calami or
Canes so abundant in the East Indies.</p>

    <div>Jacitára, <i>Lingoa Geral</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The stem of this palm is very slender, weak and
flexible, often sixty or seventy feet long, and climbing
over bushes and trees or trailing along the ground. It
is armed with scattered tubercular prickles. The leaves
grow alternately along the stem; they are pinnate,
with from three to five pairs of leaflets, beyond which
the midrib is produced and armed with several pairs of
strong spines directed backwards, and with numerous
smaller prickles. The leaflets are ovate, with the edges
waved or curled. The bases of the petioles are expanded
into long membranous sheaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow on long stalks from the axils of
the leaves and are simply branched. The spathes are
ventricose, erect, persistent and prickly, and the fruit is
globular, of a red colour, and not eatable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rind or bark of this species is much used for
making the “tipitis” or elastic plaited cylinders used
for squeezing the juice out of the grated Mandiocca-root
in the manufacture of farinha. These cylinders are sometimes
made of the rind of certain water plants and of
the petioles of several palms, but those constructed of
“Jacitára” are said to outlast two or three of the
others, and though they are much more difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>make, are most generally used among the Indian tribes.
When the cylinders are used they are suspended from
a strong pole, having been first filled with the grated
pulp. A long lever is passed through the loop at the
lower end of the “tipiti,” by means of which it is
stretched, the power being applied by a woman sitting
on the further extremity of the pole. The cylinder
thus becomes powerfully contracted, and the poisonous
juice runs out at every part of the surface and is caught
in a pan below in order to be carefully thrown away,
for it would cause speedy death to any domestic animal
which should drink it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species grows in the Catinga forests of the
Upper Rio Negro and on the margins of small streams,
climbing over trees and hanging in festoons between
them, throwing out its armed leaves on every side to
catch the unwary traveller. How often will they seize
the insect-net of the ardent Entomologist just as he is
making a dash at some rare butterfly, or fasten in his
jacket or shirt-sleeve, or pull the cap from his head!
Woe then to the impatient wanderer! a pull or a tug
will inevitably cause a portion of the fractured garment
to stay behind, for the “jacitára” never looses its hold,
and it is only by deliberately extracting its fangs that
the intruder can expect to depart unhurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some places small igaripés or forest streams are
almost filled up with various climbing grasses and
creepers, among which the “jacitára” holds a prominent
place, and it is up these streams that the Indians
often delight to fix their abode. In such cases they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>never cut down a branch, but pass and repass daily in
their little canoes which wind like snakes among the
tangled mass of thorny vegetation. They are thus
almost safe against the incursions of the white traders,
who often attack them in their most distant retreats,
carry fire and sword into their peaceful houses and take
captive their wives and children. But few white men
can penetrate for miles along a little winding stream
such as is here described, where not a broken twig or
cut branch is found to show that a human being has
ever passed before. Thus does the thorny “jacitára”
help to secure the independence of the wild Indian in
the depths of the forests which he loves.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species most nearly agrees with the <i>D. macroacanthus</i>
of Martius. Fine specimens of an allied species
may be seen growing in the Palm House at Kew.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fruit is represented on the Plate of the natural size.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Genus <span class='sc'>Bactris</span>, <i>Jacquin</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Male and female flowers intermingled in the same
spadix, the females being more abundant in the lower
parts and the males in the upper. Spathe double, exterior
short and membranous, interior complete, woody.
Male flowers with six, nine or twelve stamens. Female
flowers with three sessile stigmas, and the stamens
represented by a rudimentary ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stems in this genus are very slender, ringed,
nearly smooth or with a few scattered spines. The
leaves are more or less terminal, generally few in number,
pinnate or entire, with the bases of the petioles
much sheathing and very spiny. The spathe is also
clothed with spines. The spadices are simple or simply
branched and grow from the axils of the leaves. The
fruit is small and round, and the outer pulp is often
subacid and eatable.</p>

<p class='c007'>This very extensive genus of small prickly Palms
contains forty-six species, all natives of South America.
Two species described by Martius are here figured,
together with six others apparently new, but as it may
be impossible to identify those not seen in fruit, some
of them have been left unnamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The species here figured are all from the Rio Negro,
where I began studying them, and are sufficient to give
an idea of their general characteristics and aspect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stem of this species is from six to ten feet high,
very slender, strongly ringed or jointed and smooth,
but all other parts of the plant, the petioles, sheaths,
spathes, &#38;c., are prickly. The leaves are regularly
pinnate, with the leaflets long, narrow, pointed and
hairy beneath. The long sheathing bases of the
petioles are persistent, covering the stem often half way
down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from among the persistent leaf-sheaths;
they are very small, simple or two- or three-branched,
and have a small persistent fibrous spathe.
The fruit is very small and globular and of a red colour,
and is not eatable.</p>

<p class='c007'>This very hairy and prickly little palm grows in the
sandy Catinga forest of the Upper Rio Negro and in
the most exposed localities. It seems to agree well
with the <i>B. pectinata</i> of Martius.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stem of this species is about an inch in diameter
and ten or twelve feet high, thickly set with flat black
spines disposed in rings. The leaves are rather large
and irregularly pinnate, the leaflets being in little
groups of two or four, standing out at various angles
from the midrib, the groups themselves being set alternately
along it. The leaflets are elongate and have the
midrib produced in a bristly point, and the terminal
pair are not larger than the rest. The petioles are
armed with flat whitish spines, which on the long
sheathing bases become black.</p>

<p class='c007'>I met with this palm only once, growing in the dry
virgin forest on the banks of the Rio Negro. Though
it had neither flowers nor fruit at the time, yet its habit
is so peculiar as to leave little doubt of its being a new
species. It seems most nearly allied to the <i>Bactris
macroacantha</i> of Martius.</p>

with a few scattered groups of small spines.
The leaves are regularly pinnate, with broad leaflets

<p class='c006'>The stem of this curious palm is from twenty to twenty-five
feet high and very slender. It is marked with
slightly sunk rings and has a few scattered spines.
The leaves are rather small, few in number and terminal.
The leaflets are rigid, narrowed at the base, widest near

arranged in groups of three or four at short intervals
along the midrib, from which they stand out at different

and reed-like, but with a few spines in small groups at
the joints. The leaves are terminal, of moderate size
and rather interruptedly pinnate. The leaflets often
grow in pairs and are broad, narrowed at the base and
have the midrib produced at the point, the terminal
pair being the largest. The petioles and sheaths are
thickly set with whitish flat prickles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices are small, five- or six-branched, and
rather long-stalked. The spathe is small, smooth and

olive colour, and not eatable, the outer covering being dry
and woolly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The smooth reed-like stem of this species resembles
those of the Geonomas, and it is also remarkable for
the large size of its fruit. It grows on the dry sandy

persistent, clothed with adpressed brown spines. The
fruit is small and globular, and of a black colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>This palm was found at S. Carlos on the Upper Rio
Negro and on the “Estrada de Javita,” a road through
the forest for ten miles, which connects the river-systems
of the Rio Negro and Orinoco, and along which
most of the traffic between Venezuela and Brazil passes.
In both cases it grew in the shady virgin forest.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This most picturesque and elegant palm has the stem
slender, cylindrical, and thickly set with long needle-shaped
spines disposed in rings or bands. It reaches sixty
feet in height, and grows quite erect, though in exposed
situations it becomes curved and waving. The leaves
are very numerous, terminal, pinnate and drooping,
forming a nearly spherical crown to the stem; and the
leaflets growing out from the midrib in various directions,
and being themselves curled or waved, give the
whole mass of foliage a singularly plumy appearance.
The young plants have the leaves entire like those of
the Bussú, but as the age of the tree increases they
break up into regular narrow leaflets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from beneath the leaves, and are
small, simply branched and drooping. The spathes
are ventricose, woody and persistent, curving over the
spadix.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fruit is about the size of an apricot, of a triangular
oval shape, and fine reddish-yellow colour. In
most instances the seed is abortive, the whole fruit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>being a farinaceous mass. Occasionally, however, fruits
are found containing the perfect stony seed, and they
are then nearly double the usual size. This production
of undeveloped fruits may be partly due to change of
soil and climate, for the tree is not found wild in the
Amazon district, but is invariably planted near the
Indians’ houses. In their villages many hundreds of
these trees may often be seen, adding to the beauty of
the landscape, and supplying the inhabitants with an
abundance of wholesome food. In fact it here takes
the place of the cocoa-nut in the East, and is almost as
much esteemed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the stems are so spiny, it is impossible to climb
up them to procure the fruit in the ordinary way. The
Indians therefore construct rough stages up the sides
of the trees, or form rude ladders by securing cross
pieces between two of them, by which they mount so
high as to be able to pull down the bunches of fruit
with hooked poles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fruits are eaten either boiled or roasted, when
they somewhat resemble Spanish chestnuts, but have a
peculiar oily flavour. They are also ground up into a
kind of flour, and made into cakes which are roasted
like cassava bread; or the meal is fermented in water
and forms a subacid creamy liquid. Parrots, macaws
and many other fruit-eating birds devour them, and
tame monkeys eat them greedily, though the wild ones
cannot climb the spiny stems to obtain them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wood of this tree when old and black is exceedingly
hard, turning the edge of any ordinary axe.
When descending the River Uaupes in April 1852, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>had a number of parrots whose objections to any
restraint upon their liberty caused me much trouble.
Their first cage was of wicker, and in a couple of hours
they had all set themselves at liberty. Then tough
green wood was tried, but the same time only was
required to gnaw that through. Thick bars of deal
were bitten through in a single night, so I then tried
the hard wood of the Pashiúba. This checked them for
a short time, but in less than a week by continual
gnawing they had chipped these away and again
escaped. I now began to despair; no iron for bars
was to be procured and my resources were exhausted,
when one of my Indians recommended me to try Pupúnha,
assuring me that if their beaks were of iron they
could not bite that. A tree was accordingly cut down
and bars made from it, and I had the satisfaction of
seeing that their most persevering efforts now made
little impression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very sharp needle-like spines of this tree are
used by some tribes to puncture the skin, in order to
produce the tattooed marks with which they decorate
various parts of their bodies. Soot produced from
burning pitch rubbed into the wounds is said to make
the indelible bluish stain which these markings present.</p>

<p class='c007'>This palm appears to be indigenous to the countries
near the Andes. On the Amazon and Rio Negro it is
never found wild. It is mentioned by Humboldt as
having a smooth polished stem, which is a mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very fine specimens of this tree are growing in the
great Palm House at Kew.</p>

Male flowers with six stamens and a rudimentary pistil.
Female flowers with a short style and three stigmas,
and a ring of abortive stamens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stems of these Palms are tall, strong, and more
or less prickly. The leaves are large, pinnate, much
drooping, and forming a dense spherical head of foliage.
The leaflets are linear, and with the petioles are very
prickly. The spadix is simply branched, and the fruit
is round or oval, of an olive-green colour, and has a
firm fleshy outer covering, which is often eaten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eight species of this genus are known, inhabiting
various parts of South America, but more particularly
Brazil. One or perhaps two species are found at Pará,
but none on the Upper Amazon, where the alluvial soil
and dense forests are unsuited to their growth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stem of this tree is about forty feet high, strong,
smooth and ringed. The leaves are rather large, terminal
and drooping. The leaflets are long and narrow,
and spread irregularly from the midrib, every part of
which is very spiny. The sheathing bases of the leaf-talks
are persistent on the upper part of the stem, and
in young trees clothe it down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from among the leaves, erect or
somewhat drooping, and are simply branched. The
spathes are woody, persistent and clothed with spines.
The fruit is the size of an apricot, globular, and of a
greenish olive colour, and has a thin layer of firm edible
pulp of an orange colour covering the seed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is common in the neighbourhood of
Pará, where its nearly globular crown of drooping
feathery leaves is very ornamental. The fruit, though
oily and bitter, is very much esteemed and is eagerly
sought after. It grows on dry soil about Pará and
the Lower Amazon, but it is quite unknown in the
interior.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several young plants of this and a species closely
resembling it, the <i>A. sclerocarpa</i>, are growing in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Palm House at Kew, and in the Museum at the same
place are specimens of the stem and fruit sent by
Mr. Bates and myself from Pará.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martius mentions the <i>A. sclerocarpa</i> only as being
found at Pará, but his description of the other species
agrees best with the tree here figured. The two, however,
seem very closely allied, if they are really distinct
species.</p>

Male flowers with six stamens and a rudimentary pistil.
Female flowers with three stigmas and a rudimentary

<p class='c007'>In this genus the stems are generally lofty and
thickly set with rings of spines, but some species are
stemless. The leaves are large and pinnate, the leaflets
elongate and linear, and as well as the petioles very
prickly. The spadices are simply branched, and the
fruits are ovate or globose, with a fibrous or fleshy
covering, sometimes eatable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixteen species of these Palms are known, inhabiting
Mexico, Brazil, and other parts of South America, but
not extending higher up the mountains than 2000 feet
above the sea. They have rather a repulsive aspect,
from almost every part,—stem, leaves, fruit-stalk and
spathe, being armed with acute spines in some cases a
foot long.</p>

<p class='c006'>This palm has the stem from eight to twelve feet high,
irregularly ringed, and armed with long scattered black
spines. The leaves are terminal and of moderate size,
regularly pinnate, the leaflets spreading out uniformly
in one plane, elongate, acute, with the terminal pair
shorter and broader. The petioles and sheathing bases
are thickly covered with long black spines generally
directed downwards, and often eight inches long.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from among the leaves and are
simply branched and spiny, erect when in flower, but
drooping with the fruit. The spathes are elongate,
splitting open and deciduous. The fruit is of a moderate
size, oval, of a yellowish colour, and with a small
quantity of rather juicy eatable pulp covering the stony
seed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Upper Amazon cattle eat the fruits of the
Murumurú, wandering about for days in the forest to
procure it. The hard stony seeds pass through their
bodies undigested and become thickly scattered over the
pastures adjoining the houses. They are so hard that
it is almost impossible to break them, except by a very
hard blow with a large hammer. The internal albumen
or kernel is also excessively hard, nearly approaching
to vegetable ivory. Yet pigs are very fond of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>little cocoa-nuts, and on one estate on the Upper Amazon
where I was staying, they had scarcely anything else
to eat during a part of the year but those which had
passed through the stomachs of the cows. They might
constantly be seen cracking the shell with their powerful
jaws, and grinding up the hard kernels, on which the
teeth of few other animals could make any impression.
They not only existed on this food, but in some cases
got actually fat upon it. The black vultures (<i>Cathartes</i>)
occasionally eat the outer covering of this and other
palm fruits, when hard-pushed for food.</p>

<p class='c007'>This tree grows on the tide-flooded lands of the
Lower Amazon and on the margins of the rivers and
gapós of the Upper Amazon, though it is possible that
the two may be distinct species. The specimen figured
is from near Pará. There are living plants in the
Palm House at the Royal Kew Gardens.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This is a lofty tree, the stem growing to a height of
forty or fifty feet, with a diameter of six or eight inches.
It is covered with regular broad bands or rings of
thickly set black spines, with narrow spaces between
them. The leaves are terminal, large and regularly
pinnate. The leaflets are elongate, regularly spreading
and drooping. The midrib and expanded sheaths of
the petioles are densely clothed with long, flat, dusky
spines, having a pale expanded margin. The edges of
the leaflets are also armed with fine spines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadix is erect and simply branched, and is often
hid among the foliage. The spathe is persistent, and
the fruit is oval, of a greenish colour and not eatable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every part of this palm bristles with sharp spines so
as to render it difficult to handle any portion of it; yet
it is of great importance to the Indians, and in places
where it is not indigenous, is cultivated with care in
their mandiocca fields and about their houses, along
with the “Pupúnha” and other fruit trees. Yet they
use neither the fruit, the stem, nor the full-grown leaves.
It is only the unopened leaves which they make use of
to manufacture cordage, superior in fineness, strength
and durability to that procured from the <i>Mauritia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>flexuosa</i>. They strip off the epidermis and prepare it
in the same manner as described in the account of that
species, but while the “mirití” is principally used for
hammocks, the “tucúm” serves for bow strings, fishing-nets
and other purposes where fineness, combined
with strength, is required. Some of the tribes on the
Upper Amazon, however, make all their hammocks of
“tucúm,” which renders it probable that the <i>Mauritia
flexuosa</i> does not grow there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Brazilians of the Rio Negro and Upper Amazon
make very beautiful hammocks of fine “tucúm” thread,
knitted by hand into a compact web of so fine a texture
as to occupy two persons three or four months in their
completion. They then sell at about £3 each, and
when ornamented with the feather-work borders, at
double that sum. Most of them are sent as presents to
Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Martius has mistaken the species from which
this cordage is manufactured, stating it to be the
“Tucumá,” which, though very nearly allied, is never
used for the purpose. The close resemblance of the
native names is probably what led to the mistake,
though they are never confounded by the Brazilians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “tucúm” is found on the “terra firme” or dry
forest land of the Amazon and Rio Negro. It is growing
in the Palm House at Kew.</p>

applied to any purpose being the hard, black, oval seeds,
of which the Brazilian ladies of the Upper Amazon make
heads for their lace-making bobbins.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is unknown in the neighbourhood of
Pará and on the Lower Amazon. It first occurs near
Villa Nova, about five hundred miles up the river,
where the tidal rise and fall of the water ceases and the

point upwards it is very abundant, growing everywhere
on the margins of the rivers, in places which are for six

<p class='c006'>This palm never has any stem, the leaves springing at
once from the ground. They are eight or ten feet long,
slender and pinnate. The leaflets are very narrow and
drooping, and are disposed in groups of three or four,
at intervals along the midrib, the separate leaflets
standing out in different directions. The whole plant
is exceedingly spiny, the midrib and petioles having
long, flat, black spines directed downwards, and the
leaflets are also spiny beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadix grows from among the leaves on a long stalk
and is simply branched. The spathe is elongate
and fusiform, at first erect, but gradually bends over at
the end, forming a hood over the fruit, and is densely
clothed with spines. The fruit is oval with a produced
apex, of a pale yellow colour, and has a thin layer of
firm pulp which is sometimes eaten, but is not very
agreeable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rind of the leaf-stalks of this palm is used by
the Indians for making baskets. It grows in the dry
Catinga forests of the Upper Rio Negro, often covering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>large tracts of ground. It has altogether a rather
repulsive and inelegant appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fruit is shown on the Plate of the natural size,
and a spadix reduced showing the spathe bent over it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species has a stem two or three feet high, or is
altogether stemless like the last. The leaves are six
or eight feet long, slender and pinnate. The leaflets
are much broader than in <i>A. acaule</i>, similarly disposed
in spreading groups, but not so much drooping. The
midribs and petioles are armed with long, slender,
cylindrical spines pointing in various directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from among the leaves and are
erect and simply branched. The spathes are erect or
somewhat curved over the fruit, and clothed with
thickly set bristly spines. The fruit is globular,
covered with scattered stiff hairs, and of an orange-red
colour. It is not eatable.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species is not uncommon in the same situations
as the last. The specimen with a stem was growing in
a moister part of the forest. It seems to be an undescribed
species.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stemless and short-stemmed state of this plant
are shown on the Plate, and a fruit is represented of

<p class='c014'>Flowers bracteate, male and female in the same spadix,
and male in another spadix, on the same or on a
different tree. Spathes double, the interior one complete
and woody. Male flowers with from six to twenty-four
stamens and a small rudimentary pistil. Female
flowers with a short style and three stigmas, and a cup-shaped
ring of rudimentary stamens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stems of these palms are generally lofty, cylindrical
and smooth, but there are some stemless species.
The leaves of all are very handsome, large and regularly
pinnate; the petioles have the margins of the sheathing
bases often more or less fibrous. The spadix grows
from among the lower leaves, and is simply branched;
and the fruit is ovate or oblong, and has a dry fibrous
outer covering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixteen species of these beautiful Palms are known,
inhabiting various parts of South America, from the
level of the sea to a height of 4000 feet above it. Their
smooth and regularly pinnate leaves render them very
suitable for thatching. One species, the <i>A. funifera</i>,
produces a fibre very similar to that of the <i>Leopoldinia
piassaba</i>, and the stony seeds from the same tree supply
a kind of vegetable ivory.</p>

<p class='c006'>This noble palm has the stem fifty or sixty feet high,
straight, cylindrical and nearly smooth. The leaves are
very large, terminal and regularly pinnate. The leaflets
are elongate, rigid, closely set together, and spreading
out flat on each side of the midrib. The sheathing
bases of the petioles are persistent for a greater or less
distance down the stem, and in young trees down to
the ground, as in the <i>Œnocarpus batawá</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices grow from among the leaves and are
large and simply branched. The fruit is of large size
compared with most American palms, being about three
inches long, and from this circumstance it derives its
native name “Uauassú,” signifying “large fruit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The foliage of this tree is very extensively used for
thatching. The young plants produce very large leaves
before the stem is formed, and it is in this state that
they are generally used. The unopened leaves from
the centre are preferred, as, though they require some
preparation, they produce a more uniform thatch. The
leaf is shaken till it falls partially open, and then each
leaflet is torn at the base so as to remain hanging by
its midrib only, which is however quite sufficient to
secure it firmly. They thus hang all at right angles to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the midrib of the leaf, which admits of their being laid
in a very regular manner on the rafters. They are
generally known as “palha branca” or “white thatch,”
from the pale yellow colour of the unopened leaves, and
are considered the best covering for houses in places
where Bussú cannot be obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>This species grows on the dry forest lands of the
Upper Amazon. On the Rio Negro a stemless species
called “Curuá” (<i>Attalea spectabilis</i>) is found and is
often used for thatching. On the Lower Amazon and
in the neighbourhood of Pará the <i>Attalea excelsa</i> is not
uncommon. It is a handsome lofty species which grows
on lands flooded at high tides, and is called by the
natives Urucurí. The fruit of this tree is burnt, and
the smoke is used to black the newly made india-rubber.
Martius says that the fruit of the <i>A. speciosa</i> is used
for this purpose, but that species is not found in the
principal rubber districts, while the <i>A. excelsa</i> is abundant
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several species of <i>Attalea</i> are cultivated in the Palm
House at Kew.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some spadices with only male flowers, others with .
male and female flowers on the same tree. Spathes
large, complete, woody. Flowers with bracts. Male
flowers with three or six stamens, and with a minute
rudimentary pistil. Female flowers with a short style
and three stigmas, and rudimentary stamens forming a
membranaceous cup.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stems of these magnificent Palms are tall, erect
and smooth. The leaves are very large and irregularly
pinnate. The bases of the petioles are persistent, often
covering the stem quite down to the ground. The
spathe is woody, complete, longitudinally cut and beaked.
The spadices grow from among the lower leaves and are
simply branched, but very densely clustered with the
fruit, which is ovate, and has a dry external covering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only three species of this genus are known, all very
handsome plants. One is a native of the West India
Islands, one of Brazil, and a third is common in the
Amazon district.</p>

<p class='c006'>This palm has a lofty massive stem, smooth and obscurely
ringed. The leaves are very large, terminal
and pinnate. The leaflets are arranged in groups of
three, four or five, at intervals along the midrib, from
which they stand out in different directions, and are
very long and drooping. The bases of the petioles are
persistent a short distance down the stem, and sometimes
down to the ground, even when the trees are
forty or fifty feet high.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices are numerous, growing from the bases
of the lower leaves. They are simply branched and
very densely clustered. The spathes are large, spindle-shaped,
ventricose and woody, with a long beak. The
fruits are elongate and beaked, with a tough, brown,
outer skin, beneath which is a layer of soft fleshy pulp
of an agreeable subacid flavour, covering a hard stony
seed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leaves of this tree are truly gigantic. I have
measured specimens which have been cut by the Indians
fifty feet long, and these did not contain the
entire petiole, nor were they of the largest size. Owing,
however, to the loose irregular distribution of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>leaflets, they do not produce such an effect of great
size as those of the Jupati, which are more regular.
The great woody spathes are used by hunters to cook
meat in, as with water in them they stand the fire well.
They are also used as baskets for carrying earth, and
sometimes for cradles. The fruits are often eaten by
the Indians, and are particularly attractive to monkeys
and to some fruit-eating birds.</p>

<p class='c007'>This magnificent palm is abundant from Pará to the
Upper Amazon and the sources of the Rio Negro. It
grows only in the dry virgin forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young trees are growing in the Palm House at Kew,
and fruit clusters and spathes are preserved in the
Museum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stems of this genus are lofty, generally cylindrical

<p class='c007'>Eighteen species of <i>Cocos</i> are known, seventeen
being natives of South America, principally of Brazil,
while one only, the well-known Cocoa-nut, is a native
of the Old World, though it is now universally cultivated
in every part of the tropics. Few species of the
genus are found in the Amazon district. They appear
to prefer drier and more elevated countries, some of
them reaching an altitude of near 8000 feet above
the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stem of this well-known palm is very smooth,
seldom quite erect, and often much thicker at the bottom.
The leaves are large, terminal and regularly pinnate.
The leaflets are rigid, and spread out very flat on each
side of the midrib. From the sheathing bases of the
petioles grows a compact fibrous material resembling in
texture the spathe of the Bussú.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spadices are produced from among the leaves,
and are large and simply branched. The fruits are very
large, and have a dense fibrous external covering over
the well-known cocoa-nut.</p>

<p class='c007'>This tree is not a native of South America, but as it
is generally cultivated in every part of the tropics, I
have given a figure of it. Its peculiar characteristic
is the rigidity of its leaves, which curve or droop very
slightly, and the leaflets spread out with remarkable
flatness and regularity. The stem also is rather
massive in accordance with the immense weight of
fruit which it produces, and the whole tree, though
exceedingly handsome, has not that light and feathery
appearance which it is often represented as possessing.
It is not impossible, however, that it may have acquired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>by its naturalization in America an aspect
differing somewhat from its characteristic features
when growing on the sea-shore, on the coral islands
of India and the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>There it is of the greatest utility to man. It supplies
food and drink and oil. Its fibres are woven into
cordage and matting, and it even furnishes animal as
well as vegetable food, herds of swine being fed and
fattened entirely on its fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the banks of the Amazon, on the contrary, we
see at once that it is in a foreign land. It flourishes
indeed with great luxuriance, but no part of it is applied
to any useful purpose, the fruit only being consumed as
an occasional luxury. In the towns and larger villages
where the Portuguese have settled it has been planted,
but among the Indians of the interior it is still quite
unknown.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
